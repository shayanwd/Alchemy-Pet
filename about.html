            Too often, dogs are treated as second-class when it comes to food,
            supplements, and everyday care – subpar ingredients, outdated
            formulations, and minimal safety standards.

            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>AlchemyPet began with Marley—my soul dog.</p>
            <p>
                We got stuck in Switzerland together during the COVID lockdown.
                While the world stood still, Marley and I grew closer than ever. As
                I faced my own challenges, it was his cheerful, steady companionship
                that kept me grounded. In that stillness, I saw something he needed,
                too.
            </p>
            <p>
                At 10 years old, Marley was losing his vision and started walking
                into things. I tried regular supplements—they didn’t work. The
                prescription meds came with side effects. It wasn’t working.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I found a team of Swiss scientists to create something better.
                The result was Clear Sight—a safe, natural formula that helped
                restore not just Marley’s vision, but his spark. Since then, we’ve
                expanded our line to support even more dogs, in more ways.
            </p>
            <p>
                AlchemyPet is my promise to give back—to Marley, and to all the dogs
                who love us unconditionally.

            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>AlchemyPet began with Marley—my soul dog.</p>
            <p>
                We got stuck in Switzerland together during the COVID lockdown.
                While the world stood still, Marley and I grew closer than ever. As
                I faced my own challenges, it was his cheerful, steady companionship
                that kept me grounded. In that stillness, I saw something he needed,
                too.
            </p>
            <p>
                At 10 years old, Marley was losing his vision and started walking
                into things. I tried regular supplements—they didn’t work. The
                prescription meds came with side effects. It wasn’t working.
            </p>
            <p>
                So I found a team of Swiss scientists to create something better.
                The result was Clear Sight—a safe, natural formula that helped
                restore not just Marley’s vision, but his spark. Since then, we’ve
                expanded our line to support even more dogs, in more ways.
            </p>
            <p>
                AlchemyPet is my promise to give back—to Marley, and to all the dogs
                who love us unconditionally.
